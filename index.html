    <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
    <p>In my rough draft of the SpaceX Dragon project website, my brother informed me that there was too much white space from the configurations graph to the very bottom. Using that information, I closed the gap to make the site look busier, as if the company it represented was busy itself. My brother then noted that it looked much better and more professional in its "feng shui". My brother is a computer scientist himself and as he critiqued the site, he continued to point out small errors that could cost me in a true setting. I understand that this project was created to enforce all that we have studied and learned up until this point, but as with Programming I, I struggled immensely with terminology. I know that terminology itself is the building blocks of any class or lecture, but it never became clear. I struggled through this assignment and this semester entirely. What I did well was constantly study the material on Professor Wallace's website. If I could restart the semester, I'd ask hundreds of questions, rather than worrying about keeping up and missing out altogether. I chose not to make appropriate changes due to my lack of understanding, but mostly because of my lack of time.</p>
    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>I believe that graceful degradation is much more understandable to the common person, because it is evident as we move on to better and stronger technologies, but progressive enhancement is a perspective that people within the computer science demographic would resonate with more. Adding detail after detail on one object of content to make it more interactive, informative, and user friendly is what I've been taught up until this point, and I've only taken two programming-type classes.

Personal enhancement ensures that the end result of the content is perfection. Building a website is one thing, but ensuring that websites are able to stand the test of issues of various user-agents. Due to Progressive Enhancement being built upon a basic but firm foundation, you'll always have something to fall back on as more and more detail is added.
